# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Objective
The objective of this project is to generate a path for the car to follow and navigate on a highway in the presence of other cars safely. The Ego-car should drive around 50 miles per hour, accelerate, decelerate and change lanes based on the road and traffic conditions bound by the following criteria:
* Stay within the lane
* Speed limit: 50 MPH
* Max acceleration: 10 m/sec^2
* Max jerk: 10 m/sec^3
* No collisions

## Project Implementation
The approach used for implementing this project was mostly based on the project walk-through video. The main components of this implementation are:
* Sensor fusion - to understand the distance, speed of other cars around the car
* Path Planning - Implement a state machine for lane change
* Trajectory planning - Generate a trajectory of way points to generate a smooth trajectory for the car to follow

### Sensor Fusion
The data gathered from various sensors such as Radar, Lidar and cameras are available as sensor fusion data. This data is in a 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. Using this data, we determine the distance of the closest car in the Ego car's lane ahead, closest car ahead and behind in the lanes right and/or left to the current lane. Using the distance of closest car ahead, we determine if the car is too close and should decelerate or change lanes. The information on the distance of the closest cars ahead and behind in the adjacent lanes helps decide if it is safe to change to the other lane. The speed of the car ahead in the same lane is used to set the target speed for the Ego car. This logic is implemented in lines 270-331 in main.cpp.

### Path Planning
In this module a state machine is implemented to plan the path the car should take based on the output of the sensor fusion module. Based on the distance of the cars ahead and behind in the adjacent lanes, it is determined if it is safe to change lanes if the car ahead is within a certain range. A distance based cost is used to determine the lane change. In addition, the logic brings the car to the center lane when clear. This logic is implemented in lines 333- 367 in main.cpp.

### Trajectory Generation
The trajectory generation module generates a list of waypoints for the car to follow at each time instance. We use Frenet co-ordinates(s,d) instead of cartesian co-ordinates (x,y) to simplify the trajectory generation. The Frenet co-ordinates convey the longitudinal (s) and lateral (d) displacement of the car on the track and can convey the exact location of the car on the track. The waypoints are determined using a couple of points from the previous path and interpolating a path up to a horizon distance. The interpolation is done using a cubic spline interpolator and generates a smooth trajectory to follow. This logic is implemented in lines 369-474 in main.cpp.

## Result
The car is able to drive around the highway track successfully with no collisions. Without exceeding the speed limit and changing lanes when safe, the entire track of 4.32 miles is covered in around 5 minutes.

### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time.

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates.

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
